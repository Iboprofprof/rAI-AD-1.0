# rAI-AD-1.0
Research notebook exploring unsupervised anomaly detection on brain MRI using an EfficientAD framework, with strong discriminative performance (ROC-AUC = 0.978) despite training on normal data only.

This project uses the Brain Tumor Dataset available on Kaggle
(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ishans24/brain-tumor-dataset).

The dataset consists of brain MRI images labeled as tumor and no tumor.
It is publicly available and commonly used for research and educational purposes in medical image analysis.

In this work, the dataset was employed exclusively for research purposes.
Only healthy (no tumor) images were used for training, while both healthy and tumor images were used for evaluation, in line with the anomaly detection setting.

The raw data are not included in this repository. Users should download the dataset directly from Kaggle and comply with the dataset’s original licensing terms.
